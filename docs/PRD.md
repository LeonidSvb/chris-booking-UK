# Best of Exmoor - Product Requirements Document

A modern property rental booking platform for Exmoor vacation properties, migrated from legacy PHP to React with improved performance, user experience, and maintainability.

---

## Users & Value

- **Primary user / persona:** Vacation travelers and property owners in the Exmoor region (25-65 years old, seeking quality accommodations and property management)
- **Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD):**
  - When I search for vacation properties, I want to quickly find available accommodations with clear pricing and photos, so I can book my stay efficiently.
  - When I manage my rental property, I want to easily update availability and pricing, so I can maximize bookings without manual overhead.

---

## Success Metrics

- **Primary Goal:** Reduce page load time by 50% and improve booking conversion rate by 30% through modern React architecture
- **Success Criteria:** Property search results load in <2 seconds, booking flow completion rate >75%

## Scope

| Must-have (MVP) | Nice-to-have (Later) | Explicitly Out (Not now) |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Property search and listing | Advanced filtering (price range, amenities) | Multi-language support |
| Property detail pages with photos | Virtual tours / 360Â° images | Mobile native apps |
| Multi-step booking flow | Instant booking confirmation | Social login (Google, Facebook) |

  - [ ] Property detail pages display all info (photos, pricing, amenities, location)
  - [ ] Booking flow completes successfully with payment processing
  - [ ] Owners can login and manage their property listings
  - [ ] Page load times <2 seconds on 4G connection
  - [ ] All E2E tests pass on Chromium, Firefox, WebKit

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:

- React 19 with JavaScript (functional components + hooks)
- Vite 6 for build tool and development server
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom Exmoor theme
- TanStack Query (React Query v5) for server state management

### Backend:

- CakePHP 5 API for property management and booking logic
- Axios 1.12.2 for HTTP client with auth interceptors
- Google Maps API for property location mapping
- Payment gateway API for booking transactions

### Database:

- MySQL/PostgreSQL for property data and booking records
- Redis cache for frequently accessed property listings (5-minute staleTime)

---

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure:
- `bofe_react/` - React frontend (this application)
- `stage_exmoor/` - CakePHP 5 backend API
- `docs/` - Shared documentation (ADR, CHANGELOG)
- `scripts/` - Deployment and utility scripts

### Frontend Architecture:

**Core Libraries:**
- React Router v7 for client-side routing
- React Context API for global state (auth, booking, device detection)
- React Hook Form for form validation
- date-fns for date calculations
- Swiper + React Slick for image carousels

**Key Directories:**
- `src/pages/` - Route components (Home, Properties, Owner)
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/services/` - API service layer (propertyService, bookingService)
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `src/context/` - Context providers
- `src/utils/` - Helper functions

**State Management:**
- **Server State:** TanStack Query handles all API data fetching, caching, and synchronization
- **Client State:** React Context for auth, booking flow, device detection
- **Form State:** React Hook Form for booking and owner forms

### API Integration:

**Base URL:** `VITE_API_URL` (default: http://localhost:3001/api/v1)

**Key Endpoints:**
- `GET /properties` - List all properties
- `GET /properties/:slug` - Property details
- `POST /bookings` - Create booking
- `POST /payments` - Process payment
- `POST /auth/login` - Owner login
- `GET /owner/properties` - Owner's properties

**Authentication:**
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- Axios interceptors inject auth headers
- 401 responses trigger automatic logout

### Testing:

**E2E Testing:** Playwright
- Tests run on Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- Coverage: property search, property detail, booking flow
- Reports generated in `test-results/`

**Unit Testing:** (To be implemented)
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Coverage target: 70% for critical components
